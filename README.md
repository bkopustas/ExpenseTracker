Made to get a better understanding of Java, Spring Boot, RESTAPI

Work in progress

### Things to add: ###
+ Categories:
  - Entity connection with Expense
  - Logic for categories: CRUD, get expenses in category etc.
+ when creating an expense, if no date provided then use today's date, if provided use that
+ refactor code (creationDate -> expenseDate, etc.)
